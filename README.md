# -NRZ-to-Manchester-Signal-Conversion
This project converts NRZ to Manchester encoding using XOR logic to enable self-clocking and noise-resistant data transmission. It improves synchronization and signal integrity in systems like Ethernet and RFID, addressing NRZ's limitations in long-distance communication.
